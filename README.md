# Netflix-Dashboard
This is a Tableau project, where I’ve explored and visualized the Netflix Dataset to uncover fascinating insights about its content and growth. 📊✨

■ Project Highlights:

● Dataset Overview: Covers Netflix content from 2008 to 2021, including details like content type, duration, director, genre, and the year it was added to the platform.

● Global Contribution: Using Choropleth maps, I highlighted how India and the USA lead in content contribution. 🌍

● Netflix Growth Over Time: Analyzed the platform’s expansion by tracking the number of titles added from 2009 to 2021. 📈

● Top Insights:

1) Top 10 Directors and Top 10 Genres based on distinct content count.

2) Content-Type Ratio: Examined the distribution of content into movies, series, and more.

3) Rating Analysis: Revealed that TV-MA dominates other ratings.

● Detailed Content Information: Included separate worksheets with specific details for each title—release year, date added, duration, director, genre, and content type.

● Interactive Dashboard Design: Developed a visually engaging and comprehensive dashboard showcasing all these insights through interactive graphs and visualizations.

This project not only dives deep into Netflix’s extensive catalogue but also demonstrates how Tableau can bring data to life, making it easier to analyze and understand. 🚀
